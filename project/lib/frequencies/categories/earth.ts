    history: `Discovered by physicist Winfried Otto Schumann in 1952, this resonance represents Earth's 
    electromagnetic heartbeat. When NASA first sent astronauts to space, they experienced physical and 
    emotional difficulties due to the absence of this frequency, leading to the development of frequency 
    generators for spacecraft. This discovery highlighted the critical importance of 7.83 Hz for human health.`,
    
    science: `The Schumann resonance occurs in the cavity between Earth's surface and the ionosphere, 
    maintained by global lightning activity (approximately 50 strikes per second). This creates a standing 
    wave pattern that matches the alpha/theta brainwave transition in humans - a frequency range associated 
    with deep relaxation, enhanced learning, and healing. Modern research shows this frequency enhances 
    cell regeneration and DNA repair.`,

    history: `The second harmonic was identified during advanced Schumann resonance studies, revealing 
    a natural frequency that perfectly aligns with the human brain's focused attention state. Ancient 
    meditation traditions unknowingly utilized this frequency through specific breathing patterns and 
    practices.`,
    
    science: `This frequency corresponds to the lower beta brainwave range, supporting focused mental 
    activity while maintaining a harmonic relationship with Earth's fundamental resonance. Research shows 
    it enhances neural synchronization and cognitive performance without the stress often associated with 
    higher beta states.`,

    history: `This higher harmonic was found to correlate with advanced meditative states achieved by 
    experienced practitioners in various spiritual traditions. Ancient texts from multiple cultures 
    reference states of consciousness that modern research has linked to this specific frequency.`,
    
    science: `Operating in the high beta range, this frequency facilitates advanced cognitive processing 
    while maintaining Earth's harmonic structure. Studies show it can induce states of heightened 
    awareness and insight, particularly during focused meditation or creative activities.`,

    science: `Generated by the piezoelectric effects of Earth's inner core crystals under immense 
    pressure, this frequency provides a fundamental grounding force that influences all planetary life. 
    Research indicates it plays a crucial role in maintaining the planet's geomagnetic field and 
    supporting biological processes.`,
